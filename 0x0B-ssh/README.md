SSH

In this system engineering devops project, I practiced how to connect to and work with servers using the SSH protocol. I used an active server provided by ALX.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

â€¢	0. Use a private key

o	0-use_a_private_key: Bash script that uses ssh to connect to my ALX-provided server.

â€¢	1. Create an SSH key pair

o	1-create_ssh_key_pair: Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

â€¢	2. Client configuration file

o	2-ssh_config: SSH configuration file configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school and to refuse authentication using a password.
